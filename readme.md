## Getting Started

### Installation

- Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:issam-seghir/JavaScript30.git
   ```

> Note : As of **August 2023**, **getUserMedia() API** is considered to be in a **Secure context**, according to [MDN: getUserMedia API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia). A **"Secure context"** implies that this feature is only available in secure contexts (**HTTPS**) in some or all supporting browsers.

- Cloning the repo is sufficient for most exercises, except for `19 - webcam` & `21 - geolocation`.
- If you want to test these two exercises locally, you need to set up HTTPS for `19 - webcam` and localhost for `21 - geolocation`.
- Setting up **HTTPS** is sufficient for both. If you are genuinely interested in testing these two exercises locally, please read the following instructions.

#### Setup HTTPS

##### Step 1: Globally

- Install mkcert to generate a local certificate authority (CA) using your preferred package manager. In this example, I use Scoop, a package manager for Windows.
- The CA certification is stored in the user folder.

```bash
# Generate a local certificate authority (CA).
# (This is only trusted locally on your device.)
scoop install mkcert
mkcert -install
```

##### Step 2: Inside the project folder

```bash
# Generate a certificate for your site
# with the hostname (localhost)
cd <project-folder>
mkcert localhost
```

This will generate two files:

- `localhost.crt`
- `localhost.key`

> Note: It's important to ensure that these two files remain secret, and no one can access them. Be sure to add them to .gitignore before exposing them with a commit.

##### Step 3: Configure Your Server

```bash
# This will install http-server for you
npm install
# This will generate an HTTPS link for you
npm start
```

##### Step 4: Accept the Warning

This warning appears because the certification is self-created locally. The browser is trying to protect you, but it is safe to ignore this warning.
